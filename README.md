# Chess

This repository contains a simple, interactive chess game implemented using the Qt framework in C++. The game features a graphical user interface that allows two players to take turns moving chess pieces according to the standard rules of chess. Each piece type—Pawn, Rook, Knight, Bishop, Queen, King—has its own set of valid moves implemented within the game logic. Players interact with the game by clicking on pieces to select them and then clicking on the target square to move them.
